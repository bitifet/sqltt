CHANGELOG.txt
=============

    Cleaner engine resolution.

    Hooks implementation.

    Move to non weird template format:
      - { sql: $=>$`some sql`, /* Other parameters... /* }
    
    Backward compatibility for old-style templates (Will be kept until next
    major version number increasing).

    Added this CHANGELOG.txt file.


v0.0.2 - Few improvements for better ppooled-pg integration.

    Modifiend args() method in order to accept an already prepared arguments
    array (facilitating to use it as simple arguments formatter/checker
    accepting both formats).

    Updated README file to annotate (upcoming) ppooled-pg 0.3.0 compatibility.

    Other minor fixes.


v0.0.1 - Added README file and final project name.

    Initial implementation.
      - Multi Engine support.
      - Cli "special" engines.
      - Nested queries with smart arguments handling.
      - Example templates
