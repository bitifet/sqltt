TO-DO list & notes
==================

TO-DO
-----

  * Implement `$.keys(obj)`, `$.values(obj)` and `$.both(obj)` to retrieve
    comma separated lists of, respectively, *obj* keys (as literals), *obj*
    values (mapped through `$.arg()`) and pairs of the former joined by '='.
    This will ease the building of large insert or updates based on
    `{fieldName: "argName", ...}` JSON specifications.
